 christology_doctrine_diophysite_desc:0 "Diophysites believe that Jesus Christ had two natures: divine and human, existing alongside each other. Those two natures are joined within Jesus Christ in a complete and perfect unity, so that he is one hypostasis with two natures. This position was historically championed by the Antiochene School."
 christology_doctrine_miaphysite_desc:0 "Miaphysites believe that Jesus Christ, as Logos Incarnate, is both fully divine and fully human within one nature. This position was first established by Cyril of Alexandria at the council of Chalcedon."
 christology_doctrine_nestorian_desc:0 "The Eastern Syriac Church used a slightly different dyophysite formulation from the Roman West: Jesus Christ had two divided #italic qnome#! (≈natures), divine and human, united in a single #italic parsopa#! (≈person). While in modern times, this formulation is considered consonant with Western Dyophysitism, both positions were considered discordant historically. As such, it remains a separate formulation from Western Dyopysitism in the game." 
 christology_doctrine_arianism_desc:0 "A number of nontrinitarian positions exist including Arianism, Adoptionism, Modalism, and others. They are united in the thought that Jesus is either not God or not equal to God."
 christology_doctrine_gnostic_desc:0 "Gnosticism is a Christological doctrine which claims that the Supreme God is a Monad, from which lower, divine beings called Aeons emerge. One of the Aeons, called a Demiurge (craftsman) creates the physical universe, into which divine elements fall and are locked inside human beings. Gnosticism flourished in the early days of Christianity in the Mediterranean."
 christology_doctrine_monarchian_desc:0 "Monarchianism follows a strictly unitarian Christology, which states that God is one person, who to us can appear in three "modes" of being: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The Father is God before incarnation, the Son is all of God, residing in Jesus and the Holy Spirit (which is not a separate identity) is God in action. This view existed most prominently in the patristic period."

Severus the Great was elected on 6 November and consecrated at the Great Church of Antioch on 16 November. The autocephalous patriarchate was established in Antioch by Severus the Great in the c.6th century and was organized by Jacob Baradaeus (c.500–578) in rejection of Dyophysitism."
