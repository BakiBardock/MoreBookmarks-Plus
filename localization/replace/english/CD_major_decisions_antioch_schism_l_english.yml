 antioch_schism.0001.desc.jacobite:0 "\n\nNo longer shall the Chalcedonians spread their heresy throughout the Church of Antioch. With the establishment of churches throughout Syria, and under the rule of a mighty King, the heretical sects hold little sway over the Church of Antioch. \n\n It is only a matter of time before the rest of the Church recognizes our position."
 antioch_schism.0001.desc.maronite:0 "\n\nWith the schismatics and heretics finally driven out of our lawful inheritance, the children of Saint Maron are at last in control of the See of Antioch. The Miaphysites and Greek pretenders are at last driven out of the Eastern See. \n\nWith the backing of the Papacy, the Church in Antioch will once again thrive, free of heresy."

 antioch_schism.0101.desc.nestorian:0 "With the conquest of Syria and, by extension, the Patriarchal See of Antioch, the Church of the East is presented with a unique opportunity: to claim the seat of a Pentarch.
