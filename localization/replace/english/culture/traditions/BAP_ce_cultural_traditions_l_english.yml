 tradition_barbary_corsairs_name:0 "Barbary Corsairs"
 tradition_barbary_corsairs_desc:0 "Though the practice of piracy and raiding had always plagued the Mediterranean, the coastal Berber states were able to vastly enrich themselves at the expense of their European neighbors. Such raids were such a thorn in the side of Italian, French, and Iberian rulers that the Sicilian Normans invaded North Africa in 1135, and in 1390, a French-Genoese joint military expedition embarked on the short-lived Barbary Crusade."

 tradition_barb_horses_name:0 "Barb Horses"
 tradition_barb_horses_desc:0 "The Barb horse is a northern African breed with great hardiness and stamina and generally possesses a fiery temperament. These prize stallions bore the fierce Berber invaders during the conquest of al-Andalus and became a cornerstone of the elite mounted forces of the Iberian peninsula and beyond."
 
 tradition_nile_agriculture_name:0 "Nile Agriculture"
 tradition_nile_agriculture_desc:0 "The Nile River flows from south to north through eastern Africa. It begins in the rivers that flow into Lake Nalubaale, and empties into the Mediterranean Sea more than 6,600 kilometers to the north, making it one of the longest river in the world. The soil of the Nile River delta between El Qâhira (Cairo) and the Mediterranean Sea is rich in nutrients, due to the large silt deposits the Nile leaves behind as it flows into the sea. The banks of the Nile all along its vast length contain rich soil as well, thanks to annual flooding that deposits silt. For thousands of years, much of Egypt's food has been cultivated in the Nile delta region. Ancient Egyptians developed irrigation methods to increase the amount of land they could use for crops and support a thriving population. Canals are used to bring water from the Nile to irrigate farms and support cities. Beans, cotton, wheat, and flax were important and abundant crops that could be easily stored and traded." 

 tradition_islamic_furusiyya_name:0 "Furūsiyya"
 tradition_islamic_furusiyya_desc:0 "Furūsiyya is the historical Arabic term for knightly martial exercise during the Middle Ages, during the Crusades and Mamluk period in particular, especially concerned with the martial arts and equestrianism of the Golden Age of Islam. The body of Arabo-Persian "Furūsiyya literature" includes the genre Faras-nāma, which is an encyclopedic compilation of facts relating to horses.\n\nIt was a concept and noble art that included the arts of war and hunting, equestrianism, tactics and strategy, and certain games like chess. This art was practiced throughout the Muslim world, and saw its greatest achievement in Mamluk Egypt during the 14th century. It was part of a larger regional phenomenon of Western Eurasia that included European knighthood of the time.\n\nHowever, furūsiyya also appears to have retained a wider meaning of "the continuing ethos of manly endeavor of early Islam", comparable to the contemporary European notion of chivalry. Islamic furussiya and European chivalry has both influenced each other as a means of a warrior code for the knights of both cultures."
 
 tradition_african_agriculture_name:0 "Ifriqiyan Irrigation"
 tradition_african_agriculture_desc:0 "Once called the "granary of the empire," North Africa (also known as Ifriqiya) was one of the largest exporters of grain during the time of the Roman Empire. Grain was not the region's only product with other crops including fruit, figs, grapes, and beans. This was done through the construction and upkeep of large-scale irrigation systems fed largely by aqueducts that would collect and transport water throughout the region. Though much of the irrigation infrastructure suffered following the decline of Roman Africa and the rule of the Vandalic kingdom, the Islamic Conquest of North Africa returned a measure of stability that allowed the region to flourish once more. Under Islamic dynasties such as the Aghlabids, extensive improvements were made to the pre-existing water works in order to promote olive groves and other agriculture, to irrigate royal gardens, and for livestock. Roman aqueducts to supply the towns with water were rebuilt, expanded, and replicated across Ifriqiya. In the Kairouan region hundreds of basins were constructed to store water for the raising of horses."
