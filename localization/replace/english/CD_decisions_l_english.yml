 cad_decision.0005.t:0 "Importance of the Law"
 cad_decision.0005.desc:0 "Hardly any time has passed since we made clear our intent to establish an autocephalous church, and already there is a debate among the clergy over the enforcement of church law. One faction proposes that the church hierarchy have the authority to cut off sinners and heretics by means of excommunication. Another supposes church laws be made subject to the laws of the state. But still another faction goes so far as to argue that the laws of the state absorb those of the church, thereby giving us the authority to make rulings in religious affairs."
 cad_decision.0005.a:0 "It is best that the church have full jurisdiction over spiritual affairs."
 cad_decision.0005.b:0 "Is not the King appointed by God? The state can surely handle some of these matters."

 cad_decision.0006.desc:0 "With the matter of the law settled, the question has now emerged over how best to worship. A particular faction proposes that pilgrimages to our holy sites should be preferred. Others, however, claim that the study of the scriptures is the ideal and most profitable form of worship. The more fringe groups propose that mystical ceremonies be used to draw near to God."
 cad_decision.0006.a:0 "Let the peasants go into the chapels to worship."

 cad_decision.0007.t:0 "The Fate of the Monasteries"
 cad_decision.0007.desc:0 "With the great deal of deviations from our former church, some have begun to question the importance of the monasteries. The traditionalists insist that the communal monastic life is most profitable to the christian people. Others, however, have begun to question the need for community, and instead assert the ascetics should live as hermits. Meanwhile, a new group of mendicants have emerged, who believe that the religious ought to be out in the cities doing good works, instead of locked up in convents and praying."
 cad_decision.0007.a:0 "The old ways are just fine."
 cad_decision.0007.b:0 "What need is there for community? Let the religious go and pray alone."
 cad_decision.0007.c:0 "Let the religious go out into the community and do good works."

 cad_decision.0008.t:0 "The Fate of the Communion"
 cad_decision.0008.desc:0 "As our autocephaly has become clearer, there has emerged concerns over whom we shall enter communion with. Parties loyal to Rome and Constantinople have strung up among both clergy and lay, with many proposing that we stay completely independent. More concerningly, this confusion has allowed certain heterodox clerics to voice their opinions. If this is not settled soon, our experiment with autocephaly will surely fail."
 cad_decision.0008.a:0 "We don't need no man!"
 cad_decision.0008.b:0 "Constantinople will surely grant us more independence than Rome."
 cad_decision.0008.c:0 "The scriptures are quite clear that it was Peter to whom the keys were granted."
 cad_decision.0008.d:0 "It appears to me that Christ had only one nature."
 cad_decision.0008.e:0 "How can one person have two natures? Clearly Christ is two persons."
 cad_decision.0008.f:0 "There was a time where the Son was not; ergo Christ is not God."
