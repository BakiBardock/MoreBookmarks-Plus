 african_folk_islam_desc:0 "With the rapid growth of the trans-saharan trade from the 9th Century, Africans from the west and the Sahel came into increasing contact with Islamic teachings. In order to ensure access to lucrative markets and help maintain the ongoing peace which ensured the trade of gold and salt thrived many rulers within West Africa have chosen to convert to Islam. Nevertheless traditional beliefs in magical healing, spirits, and divination persist amongst the new adherents."
