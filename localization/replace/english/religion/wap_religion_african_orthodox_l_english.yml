 nubian_orthodox_desc:1 "Founded in the 6th-century following Byzantine-sponsored mission led by John of Ephesus, The Nubian Orthodox Churches grew rapidly with the support of Nubian ruling elites, and was united under Chalcedonian Christianity by the 8th-century. Although initially Coptic in orientation and loyal to the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria, with centuries of Muslim rule in Egypt the influence and power of the Coptic Patriarch waned. In the 11th-century led by the Archbishop of Dongola - the head of the Nubian Orthodox Church, a process of 'Nubianization' of the church took place. With Old Nubian replacing Greek and Copt in the liturgy and religious texts, and only nominal recognition being given to Alexandria by what was now an effectively national church."
