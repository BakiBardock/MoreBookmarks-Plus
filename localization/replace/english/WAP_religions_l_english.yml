Ha-Mim espoused a new religion that combined Islam with traditional Berber practices and beliefs and claimed to have received a divine revelation in the Berber language. Ha-Mim even went to the extent of transcribing his vision into a new  Berber language Qu'ran. Receiving widespread support amongst the Ghomara tribe whose belief in him would last for centuries after, Ha-Mim's movement also featured prominent female leaders including his Aunty Tanqit, and his famously beautiful sister, Daggu. The prominent role of women within Ha-Mimite leadership was a call back to the powerful Berber queens of the pre-Islamic North Africa."
